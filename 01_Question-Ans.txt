Var:-
  var() function is used to define and reference custom properties, also known as CSS variables. 
  CSS variables are used to store and reuse values that can be applied to various parts of your stylesheet. 
  The primary purpose of using the var() function is to make your CSS code more maintainable, flexible, and dynamic by 
  allowing you to define values in a central location and reuse them throughout your stylesheet.

1. Dynamic Value Updates: 
    CSS variables can be dynamically updated using JavaScript, making it possible to change the look and feel 
    of a webpage based on user interactions or other factors. You can use JavaScript to modify the values of custom 
    properties, and any CSS properties that reference those variables will automatically reflect the changes.

2. Code Reusability: 
   CSS variables promote code reusability by allowing you to use the same values throughout your 
   stylesheet. This reduces redundancy, makes your code more maintainable, and helps ensure consistency in your design.

3. Enhanced Maintainability: 
   Using CSS variables reduces the chances of errors and makes your code more maintainable. When you use variables, 
   it's easier to understand the purpose of a value and track down where it is used in your styles.
